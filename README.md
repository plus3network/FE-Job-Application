Front End Engineer Job Application
==================

The purpose of this repository is to get a feel for how you would execute a basic task of creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from a mockup with annotations. The test is to take an annotated mockup and create a 1 page web site using the [Twitter Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). 

## Requirements

- HTML5
- All CSS should be built using [Less CSS](http://lesscss.org/)
- Use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) elements as much as possible.
- Use [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) 1.7.2+ for any custom JavaScript

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a directory named ``public`` with 3 subdirectories for your CSS, JavaScript and images – you can choose the names for these directories.
3. Create an HTML document and name it ``index.html`` at the root of the ``public`` directory. You can name your CSS, Less and JavaScript files whatever you want as long as they are located in the directories you created in step 2.
4. Create a 1 page web site base on the design in the ``mockup.png`` file. 
5. When you've completed the task send a pull request.
