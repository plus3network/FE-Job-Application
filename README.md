Front End Engineer Job Application
==================

Thank you for your intrest in working with Plus 3 Network. Before we get started we need to get a feel for how well you can follow instructions and evalute your front end development skills. You will be expected to create a one page web site using the [Twitter Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) based on the [provided mockup](https://raw.github.com/plus3network/FE-Job-Application/master/mockup.png). This evaluation should take about an hour or so depending on your familuarity with each of the frameworks.

## Requirements

- Use HTML5
- All CSS should be built using the [Less CSS](http://lesscss.org/) language
- Use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) elements as much as possible
- Use [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) 1.7.2+ for any custom JavaScript
- Bonus Tip: Use Backbone.js

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a directory named ``public`` with 3 subdirectories for your CSS, JavaScript and images – you can choose the names for these directories.
3. Create an HTML document and name it ``index.html`` at the root of the ``public`` directory. You can name your CSS, Less and JavaScript files whatever you want as long as they are located in the directories you created in step 2.
4. Create a one page web site base on the design in the [``mockup.png``](https://raw.github.com/plus3network/FE-Job-Application/master/mockup.png) file. 
5. Upon completion, send a pull request for review.
